"""Questions we ask the Archive.

YOU IMPLEMENT THIS FILE.

Every function here takes `records` — a list of record dicts as produced by
load_archive — and answers one question about the collection. None of them
touch a file. None of them print anything. They return values.

Keep in mind from Week 2: the structure you are given decides which of these
is cheap and which is expensive. All of these are linear scans over a list.
Note in your README which one would be instant with a dictionary instead.
